# point-in-polygon
This is the coursework for UCL MSc CEGE0096 Geospatial Programming.

This software written by Python is aimed to solve the PiP problem, in other words, to detect the geometric relationship between points and a polygon.

Pycharm software in MacOS environment was used to write this Python program ([Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)), no additional libraries and packages are needed. Given Python's cross-platform nature, any computer using Python version 3.8 can theoretically debug and process this program.

Anyone with a basic Python or programming background can easily run the program by clicking the green triangle run button on the Pycharm interface. The whole software is stored in several files, including ‘main_from_file.py’, ‘main_from_user.py’, ‘plotter.py’, ‘class_geometry.py’, ‘polygon.csv’, ‘input_data.csv’. Each of them has a unique purpose, it is important to note that all relevant files need to be stored under the same path, otherwise, you will need to adjust the code to add the file path to make the program run normally.
